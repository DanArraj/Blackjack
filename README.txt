This program allows a user to play blackjack against the dealer. The dealer will hit until their hand has a value of 17 or greater or until they bust. 
The program can account for natural blackjacks and keeps a record of what cards in the deck were dealt. If a game is played long enough for 35 cards to be dealt the dealer will shuffle the deck.
